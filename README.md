- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rubayi17753
- 👀 I’m interested in a) Eurasian languages, history, and culture past and present and b) historical and computational linguistics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, C#, Python, HTML, and other languages that would aid me in achieving my goals.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project related to historical linguistics and philology (e.g. digital transcription of historical texts).
- 📫 How to reach me ...
